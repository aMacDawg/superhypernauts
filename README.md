# superhypernauts
Hack project for Supercell x AI Labs Oct 2025

## Overview

Goal is building a fun prototype that demonstrates a fun core loop + emergent gameplay powered by AI including Hypernym.ai, Unity, (MCP) and Hyper3D!

## Disclaimer

This demo was created by @aMacDawg who also started learning Unity for real for this Hack and the performance (lack thereof) experienced in this demo is not indicative of ideal "production" performance

The goal was to get deeper into gamedev DX tooling...and demonstrate to some of our own prospective gamedev users how Hypernym can serve their emergent genAI needs
